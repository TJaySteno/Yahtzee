Welcome to Yahtzee!

I created this app as a challenge for myself in the first couple of months I started learning JavaScript (March 2017) and the first version was complete two weeks later. What you see here is the second version of that app which has been refactored to be easier to read and DRY.

My focus with this project and my learning in general has been the JavaScript. At some point I may improve the webpage design, but for now just know that my focus has been on functionality of this and other apps.

Thank you and enjoy!
